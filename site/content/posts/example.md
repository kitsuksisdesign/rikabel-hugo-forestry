I'm Rik, hi! I'm an English web developer/UX/UI/designer type person living on beautiful Vancouver Island.

This is a brand new site. I'll be building it in the coming weeks. I'm using [Hugo.io](https://gohugo.io/ "GoHugo - super fast static site generator") (content-management-centric static site generator built in [golang](https://golang.org/ "Go Language")) + [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/ "Forestry.io - super slick content UI ") (nice content creation UI over Hugo, using [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax "Markdown - simple markup syntax") and git under the hood) + [netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/ "netlify.com - Build, deploy, and manage modern web projects") for continuous, automatic deploys of pre-rendered markup and media to a super fast global CDN for next to no money. All coordinated through [github.com](https://github.com/ "GitHub") (you can also use [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/ "GitLab") or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/ "Bitbucket innit")) fI find this _quite_ exciting. All hail the [#JamStack](https://jamstack.org/ "JAMStack.org").

I used [create-static-site](https://github.com/forestryio/create-static-site "Static site generator with dependencies included and smart defaults") to quickly build a hugo-powered site with **zero build configuration**.

From the repo page:

> Philosophy
>
> * **One Dependency:** There is just one build dependency. It uses Webpack, Babel, ESLint, PostCSS, and other amazing projects, but provides a cohesive curated experience on top of them.
> * **No Configuration Required:** You don't need to configure anything. Reasonably good configuration of both development and production builds is handled for you so you can focus on writing code.
> * **No Lock-In:** You can “eject” to a custom setup at any time. Run a single command, and all the configuration and build dependencies will be moved directly into your project, so you can pick up right where you left off.

No monolithic CMS - all content and dev files are contained in the same repo. Minimal configuration - I started setting this site up less than 30 minutes ago and have already got a local install, git repo, forestry.io integration, netlify integration and continuous deployment globally to a custom domain. Wow.

Faster, safer, easier, funner! I can actually focus on doing design and development rather than endless tedious configuration, updating, etc.

If this sounds like your jam (stack) check out this video by the author of  [create-static-site](https://github.com/forestryio/create-static-site "Static site generator with dependencies included and smart defaults"), Chris McCrea.

OK, I'm going to post this now and see how that goes.Hopefully it all syncs up automagically and away we go!
